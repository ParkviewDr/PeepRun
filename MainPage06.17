     <div class="row">
    <div class="col">
<p> Jasmin has over 15 years of experience in the fitness industry and is a VDOTO2 Certified
Distance Running Coach as well as a Certified Strength and Conditional Specialist with the
National Strength and Conditioning Association (NSCA-CSCS).
As a kid growing up and playing basketball in Bosnia, he dreamed of playing in the NBA. He
came as close as 10 vertical inches away from being drafted. After that “close call”, he
refocused his attention on college and decided to pursue an interest in human performance and
exercise. He moved to New Hampshire, studied at the University of New Hampshire and earned
a Bachelor of Science in Kinesiology.</div></div>
 <div class="row">
    <div class="col">
His passion is educating clients about fitness while giving them the tools to achieve their goals,
whether it be a competitive and/or recreational endurance athlete looking to set their personal
best or a client looking to lose a few pounds. He believes having S.M.A.R.T. goals and a plan is
important to staying on track and reaching success. He helps clients achieve their goals by using
simple, effective and proven fitness principles.
He frequently competes in the local running circuit where you can find him running anything
from 5k’s to an ultra marathon. He loves the competitive challenge that racing brings and the
disciplined training it requires for achieving a specific goal. Plus, nothing beats the post race
pizza and beer. </p>
